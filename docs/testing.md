Because tests are using in-memory [H2 database](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) you don't need to have any database running on your machine. Check out easy setup of in-memory database in `FlatSpecWithSql` trait.

When you issue `test` from SBT, tests for both server-side and client-side components are run. SBT integrates some Grunt commands and executes tests for browser part via Grunt too.

## UI Tests

It is also possible to run UI tests, which are located in the `ui-tests` subproject. This subproject is not aggregated in the normal build and hence these tests must be run manually. To do it, simply run sbt in the bootzooka project directory, switch to `ui-tests` project and invoke the tests task.

    $ sbt
    [info] Loading project definition from /Users/pbu/Work/bootzooka/project/project
    [info] Loading project definition from /Users/pbu/Work/bootzooka/project
    [info] Compiling 1 Scala source to /Users/pbu/Work/bootzooka/project/target/scala-2.11/sbt-0.13/classes...
    [info] Set current project to bootzooka-root (in build file:/Users/pbu/Work/bootzooka/)
    > project ui-tests
    [info] Set current project to bootzooka-ui-tests (in build file:/Users/pbu/Work/bootzooka/)
    > test

Alternatively you can run a single test using the test-only task.

    > test-only uitest.ScalaRegisterUITest

These tests are written using WebDriver and __you need Firefox 20__ to properly run them.
